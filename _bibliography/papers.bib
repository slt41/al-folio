  abstract = {This paper details challenges facing people with hearing loss in engagement with connected technologies and identifies priority areas for technology intervention and development. Whether they like it or not, people with hearing loss may depend on a hearing person or technologies (e.g. hearing aid and voice recognition to text) to communicate and interact with the hearing world. While technology intervention can reduce needs for help from hearing people, it inevitably increases dependency on technologies. This can lead to people with hearing loss feeling out of control, especially when communication technologies do not function as expected, often without any back-up, failsafe or contingency plans. Without reliable technologies – mainstream and/or specialist – to bridge the gap between visual- and voice-based (oral) communications, people with hearing loss are at risk of isolation and exclusion.},

  abstract = {This report looks at the amount of safety and privacy information that is publicly available about Internet connect devices that are targeted at children. By reviewing the documentation and
advertisements related to 15 prominently marketed devices for children it tries to determine how easy it is for the purchasers of the device to understand whether devices connect to the Internet,and if so, what security and privacy implications it has for carers and for the children themselves. It
finds that it is uniformly hard to determine the nature of technology within any given device; wheredevices do connect to the Internet, no information is provided to users regarding privacy and
security best practices, and how functional the device is without connection to the Internet. Similarly, there is limited explanation of the personal data that must be provided to make the device
run as intended, and also of how to delete this information once the device is no longer in use. The report comes up with a number of considerations for carers who have children with connected
devices, and recommendations for device manufacturers, to promote a more informed purchasing process, and a less risky environment for children’s play and development.}
